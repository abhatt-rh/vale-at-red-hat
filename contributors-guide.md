# Contributor's guide

Things you can do to get started:

* Review the [project goals](project-goals.md).

* Install Vale and configure it to use the Red Hat style.

* Create a new style rule: 
  1. [Create a Feature request](https://github.com/rolfedh/studious-fortnight/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) for a new style rule.
  2. Use [Vale rule editor](https://vale-studio.errata.ai/) to create a new rule.
  3. Paste the rule to a `*.yml` file and add it to a style you're using.
  4. Validate the new rule against a collection of documentation files.
  5. If you see ways to refine the rule, do so.
  6. Contribute your rule to the style for peer review and merge.

* Improve an existing style rule.
  1. [Create a Bug report](https://github.com/rolfedh/studious-fortnight/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) for an existing style rule.
  2. Find and copy the rule from one of the Red Hat styles.
  3. Update the rule using [Vale rule editor](https://vale-studio.errata.ai/).
  4. Validate and refine the rule, if needed.
  5. Contribute your rule to the style for peer review and merge.
