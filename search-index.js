Add the following configuration to the .github/workflows/vale.yml file: name: Linting with Vale on: - pull_request jobs: vale: name: Linting with Vale runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Vale Linter uses: errata-ai/vale-action@reviewdog with: fail_on_error: false vale_flags: \"--no-exit\" files: __onlyModified onlyAnnotateModifiedLines: true env: # Required, set by GitHub actions automatically: # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}} Optional: Change the default configuration to suit the requirements of your project.
